# Animation_test
Animation test on android.bitmap

This is a test app to determine the capabilities of android.bitmap for me. 

Test was succesfull in creating a simple interactive background for an app. Bitmap was determined to be inefficient for animations but sufficient for simple backgrounds.

Usage: press the TextView in the middle of the screen (shows time) and the dots on the background should dissapear in a circular motion. 

NOTE: This apk is made for Android mobile phones so it must be run on an Android device or an Android emulator.
